ChoiceEngine
game engine allowing to build a story from interlinked events tha can be modified by multiple choices

- the exoteric goal of the game is to prevent the final event of the story by changing the choices made by the story protagonist

- the esoteric and real goal is to unravel the whole story and the people and factions involved as a whole

- the game loop:
  1.  Game: present the final event with details concerning the place, the time and the circumstances
  2.  Player: choose a period in the timeline
  3.  G: present a list of known decisions made by the story protagonist
  4.  G: show hints to unknown decisions
  5.  P: select a decision and modify it
  6.  P: choose another period (2), decision (5), make guesses about hidden decisions (7) or confirm the choices (10) 
  7.  G: present a list of possible hidden decisions (which exist in one of the story events even if not at the chosen period)
  8.  P: search or select an action
  9.  G: reveal a hidden decision and tell if no more hidden decisions are left (5)
  10. G: present the final event according to the changed decisions  


   
basic goals:

Game Interface
- a filled rectangle representing the timeline with parameterized number of squares along the timeline representing dates
  - for each square add a "!" and or a "???" representing known and unknown events occurring on this date
  - don't show "???" if no events are known for the date
  - the last square representing the date on which the final event has occurred is colored differently
- move a triangular cursor along the timeline stopping at each square
- show details of the date under the cursor:
  - known events with the format: "! <time> <event title>>"
  - unknown events with the format: "???" (one line only even if multiple unknown events exists for this date)
- when the cursor stops on a date with known events, show a <more info button>
-when clicking the <more info button>, open a popup rectangle widget containing the following details:
  - <back to time line button>
  - <year, month and day>
  - list of events:
    - "! <time> <place> <event title>"
  - line for unknown events: "???"
  - the cursor can move up and down the list => an <expand button> or a <guess button> is displayed at the end of the line
  - the cursor can click the <back to time line button>
  - the cursor can click the <expand button> => a blurb of text is shown with details of the known event
  - the cursor can click the <guess button>
    - open the guess window
- when the cursor stops on a date with no known events show a <guess button>
- when clicking the <guess button>, open the guess window
